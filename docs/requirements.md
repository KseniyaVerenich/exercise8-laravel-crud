# Laravel CRUD app

### Description

Create a generic CRUD app that you can furthur style to make it unique for your own specific use. You should be able to take pieces from this exercise for future CRUD applications, since 99% of all software relies on Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

By default, the app should:
* add a new (item),
* read "display" data from the (item), 
* update data in (item),
* delete (item),

Where (item) is some type of database table object that would be interesting to you. (list of users, types of socks, scooter inventory, ingredients for meals, plant database, hat store, etc. make it unique and personalized to you.)

You will need at least one page (all functions on one page, like the todo list) or you could split each CRUD operation on a unique page, or have an add view, and a display view which allows you to also update or delete. Does not matter, as long as it works.

#### Wireframe

See [wireframe](https://github.com/bootcamp-s19/exercise8-laravel-crud/blob/master/docs/demo.gif)

This is just one of many many different ways to make a crud app, style it to your hearts content. 

#### Tech Stack

1. Bootstrap V4 (html, css)
2. Vue.js (js)
3. Sequel Pro (mysql)
4. Laravel (PHP)

### Objectives

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
###### Setup:
1. Fork repo `exercise8-laravel-crud`
2. Locally, navigate to your `Sites` folder in the terminal
3. `git clone` + `your-repo-name` into your Sites folder
4. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
5. Create necessary files for application via CLI
6. Import necessary css/js/php files (Bootstrap, Vue.js, Laravel)

###### Optional Setup for eslint
1. in your repo top directory, 
2. `npm init`
3. `eslint --init`
4. add the following line to your `.gitignore`
   1. `node_modules/`

###### Develop:
1. Add content and elements to your website
2. View changes locally with MAMP (localhost)
3. Debug using the tools you have (Chrome Devtools, VS Code breakpoints, Vue.js overlay, Laravel serve)
4. Save often, and commit to github when important changes happen
###### Deploy:
1. Push your code to Github remote
2. Post links to your Github repo to the [exercises Slack channel](https://bootcamp-s19.slack.com/messages/CGD9QUH6E/)

### Requirements

Website must use laravel for the backend, database, and crud operations, use Vue.js for interactivity from the backend to the frontend, and be responsive using bootstrap for the front end.

Use bootstrap-vue for your components, use laravel for the views and organization of the code. 

### Remember to push to Github!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.

### If you finish early...
1. Improve error messaging to be more specific to the terminal.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
